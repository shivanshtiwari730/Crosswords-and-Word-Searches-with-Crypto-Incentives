## Project Description

"Crosswords and Word Searches with Crypto Incentives"  is an innovative platform where players can enjoy word puzzle games like crosswords and word searches while earning cryptocurrency as a reward for their efforts. By leveraging blockchain technology, this project introduces a fun and engaging way for puzzle enthusiasts to earn crypto tokens by completing challenges and improving their word-solving skills.

The platform uses a smart contract that interacts with a blockchain-based ERC-20 token to provide users with crypto rewards based on their performance in the games.

## Project Vision

The vision of this project is to merge the world of casual gaming with cryptocurrency incentives, motivating users to engage with educational puzzles while also gaining tangible rewards. Through this, we aim to create a sustainable ecosystem where users enjoy solving puzzles, improving their language and cognitive skills, and benefiting financially through crypto.

- **Encourage Learning**: Offer a fun, interactive way to engage in crossword and word search puzzles.
- **Gamified Incentives**: Provide a reward-based system that encourages regular participation and achievements.
- **Tokenized Rewards**: Integrate an ERC-20 token to reward users with cryptocurrency for their achievements.

## Key Features

1. **Play and Earn**: Players can play crossword and word search games to accumulate points based on performance, which are then converted into cryptocurrency rewards.
  
2. **Customizable Rewards**: The owner of the contract can adjust the reward rate (tokens per score) to balance gameplay and reward distribution.

3. **Blockchain-Based Transparency**: All rewards and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and accountability.

4. **ERC-20 Token Integration**: Rewards are distributed in the form of a customizable ERC-20 token. This provides seamless integration with various wallets and exchanges.

5. **Smart Contract Automation**: The entire game and reward mechanism is automated via the smart contract, ensuring efficiency and reducing the need for intermediaries.

6. **Withdraw and Token Management**: The contract owner can manage the token balance and withdraw tokens to ensure liquidity and continuous operation of the reward system.

### Future Improvements
